## Features

    This sample provides an enhanced version of the SearchWidget for the Flex Sample Viewer.
This enhanced version allows you to open a datagrid from the SearchWidget that has its own
specified fields that are independent of the fields that are specified for the SearchWidget.
The DataGrid is also an enhanced DatGrid that automatically resizes the columns to fit the data
inside of them and also for hyperlink fields to be specified. The DataGrid is fully integrated 
with the SearchWidgets results so when you select a row in the datagrid the same record is 
selected in the SearchWidgets results and vice versa. The DataGrid is in a floating container 
so it can be moved to anywhere on the screen, but is not resizable.

    The intention of this enhancement is to allow a minimal amount of attributes to be displayed
in the standard SerachWidget's results and info window and also allow for detailed or numerous 
attributes to be displayed when the user what more information.


What's in the zip file:

ExportButtonSkin.mxml  	- This is a simple skin to allow the display of a good graphic on a button with text.
HyperLinkColumn.mxml        	- Allows for the Datagrid to have a field that contains a url to function as a hyperlink.
SearchResult.as			- This is basically the attributes of the search results.
SearchResultDatagroup.as	- This is the event dispatcher for the search results.
SearchResultItemRenderer.mxml	- This is the item renederer for the Spark data group that displays the search results.
SearchWidget.mxml  		- Standard ESRI SearchWidget Enchanced to add the floating DataGrid and interaction between results and DataGrid, 
				  and remove Shape_Length, Shape_Area fields from the results.
SearchWidget.xml                - Standard ESRI SearchWidget configuration file with many additions to configure the enhanced features of this widget.
SearchWidgetFloatDG.mxml        - A customized datagrid that automatically resizes the columns to fit the data and is in a floating canvas.
SearchWidgetFloatDGSkin.mxml    - This is a skin that allows the use of the export button skin and the close widget button skin on the form.
WidgetCloseButtonSkin.mxml	- I created this skin so that it would not be necessary to create a png for the close button that matched the 
				  current theme	being used.
i_table2.png			- a icon file for the button that brings up the floating DataGrid
i_searchspatial.png		- a icon for the spatial search.
i_draw_draw.png			- a icon for the use of the draw widgets graphics


## Requirements
- The ArcGIS Flex API 2.x or greater swc. Download it here:  http://resources.esri.com/arcgisserver/apis/flex/index.cfm?fa=downloadDisclaimer
- Internet access to the ArcGIS Online servers
- Web Server to deploy the application

## How to install


**********************************************************************************
** IMPORTANT FOR the use of existing draw graphics to be used for the graphical **
** search you need to follow the next step below                                **
**********************************************************************************
 - Add the following lines to the DrawWidget.mxml in the init function under this line 'graphicsLayer = new GraphicsLayer();'
	graphicsLayer.name = "Draw Features";
	graphicsLayer.id = "Draw Features";


For both the compiled and uncompiled version you need to copy the contents
of the assest/images to your projects assets/images folder.

To install using the compiled version just copy the folder called eSearch
under the Widgets folder, and add this line to your config.xml

<widget label="Enhanced Search" left="60" top="400"
                icon="assets/images/i_search.png"
                config="widgets/eSearch/SearchWidget.xml"
                url="widgets/eSearch/SearchWidget.swf"/>

For the Uncompiled you need to copy the eSearch folder to src/widgets

Finalize the install for Uncompiled version:
 - In Flex Builder on the left of the screen is the FlexNavigator tree, right click you Flex Sample Viewer project
   and go to properties
 - In the Properties dialog choose Flex Compiler in the left window.
 - Ensure your Flex SDK Version is 4.0
 - Check Require Flash Player Version under HTML Wrapper and enter 10.0
 - Now Flex Modules in the left window.
 - On the right hand side of the dialog will be an add buton click it
 - browse to src\widgets\eSearch and add the SearchWidget.mxml
 - click ok all the way out.
 - Change the SearchWidget.xml just like you would in the original SearchWidget that ESRI provided and add your gridfields
   and gridhyperfields (these are optional if you do not want a datagrid for a particular layer then just leave these
   elements empty.

Thats it enjoy, if you have any comments or suggestions just post a comment on the code gallery.
